We think that understanding how your body works physically and mentally and monitoring key elements can help you achieve that goal that has seemed impossible.</p>

                    <h4>Background</h4>
                     <p>Dr Tamsin Lewis is a one of the top ranked Ironman 70.3 athletes in the world and races as a professional triathlete. 

                    Tamsin studied Medicine & Surgery at Kings College London and also has a Bachelor of Science degree in NeuroScience and Anatomy. </p>

                    <p>Training as a triathlete alongside working full-time as a doctor, Tamsin won the World Age-Group Olympic Distance Triathlon Championships in 2009 and was offered the opportunity by Brett Sutton to join <a href="http://www.teamtbb.com/" target="_blank">Team TBB</a> and ‘turn pro’. Since 2010 Tamsin has raced and podiumed around the world in triathlon.</p>

                    <p>During this time of racing and training as a professional athlete, Tamsin has experienced first hand, injury, overtraining, anaemia, mineral depletion and misdiagnosis by NHS services. </p>

                    <p>As a result this fuelled a desire to help others overcome what she learnt the hard way. Studying for a Masters in Sports Medicine afforded the opportunity to research what is required to perform at your best. In addition Tamsin has worked with some of the top triathlon coaches in the world and has an ever inquisitive mind to keep learning and improving. </p>

                    <p>2013 was Tamsins most successful racing season. She attributes this to close management of a variety of blood markers to monitor fatigue and recovery in conjunction with a strong coaching relationship.</p>
