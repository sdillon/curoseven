django version of the site (index only for now)

I split the original index.html into header, carousel, marketing, footer, and this seems to have slightly messed things up - not sure why at the moment.

TODO:
- fix layout bug
- add extra pages

It's currently hosted on pythonanywhere.com:

http://tdiethe.pythonanywhere.com/sales/

I'm just using their free account which means I can't share the repo on there, and it's a bit limited (no ssh access etc), but it's quite a good sandbox.

Files are served using WSGI
